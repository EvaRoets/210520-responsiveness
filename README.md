## 🎯 Objectives
- Learn about CSS media queries

## ✔️ Specifications
- Complete these exercises to get a good sense of them
- Do **NOT** use any CSS frameworks

### 🌱 Must-haves
#### 1️⃣ Change the color
Create an HTML file and a CSS file. Make the background color of the body **red** when the width of the viewport is smaller than 480px, **green** when the viewport width is bigger than (or equal to) 480px and smaller than 1024px, and **blue** when the viewport is bigger than (or equal to) 1024px. If you want prettier colors, try https://colorhunt.co/ for inspiration.

💡 `480` and `1024` are also called **breakpoints**. They are typically used as threshold between _cell phone_, _tablet_, and _computer_.

#### 2️⃣ Display / hide elements

Add three `div`: one div with the id="small", one div with the id="medium", another div with the id="large". In each element add the word small, medium and large respectively as content for display purposes. Make it so only one div is displayed, according to the width of the current viewport.

#### 3️⃣ Adapt the size of the text according to the device

In each div, add a title and a few paragraphs (lorem ipsum, and such). Give the title a descriptive text (for example: "Content for smartphones"). Change the font size according to the device type.

#### 4️⃣ Re-Arrange

Make it so that :
- if small, the 3 divs are stacked on top of one and other.
- if medium, the first div takes 2/3 of width, the second 1/3 of width and the third the full width.
- if big, the 3 divs should be next to one another.
